# Fake Review Detection in E-Commerce

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake reviews on e-commerce platforms using Machine Learning. Fake reviews can mislead customers, harm brand reputation, and reduce trust in online marketplaces. We build a classification model using **Logistic Regression** to identify deceptive reviews, supported by Explainable AI techniques such as **LIME** and **SHAP** for interpretability.
